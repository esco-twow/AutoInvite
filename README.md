Auto Invite
This is a simple addon that allows auto inviting people via whisper or guild chat if the message matches.
Currently only one invite message can be specified at a time, and is not case sensitive.


## Commands
```
/ai               - Configure, list commands
/ai on            - Turn on auto invites
/ai off           - Turn off auto invites
/ai guild on      - Turn on auto invites for guild chat
/ai guild off     - Turn off auto invites for guild chat
/ai whisper on    - Turn on auto invites for whispers
/ai whisper off   - Turn off auto invites for whispers
/ai raid on       - Convert group to raid when creating
/ai raid off      - Don't convert group to raid when creating
/ai login on      - Disable auto invites whenever you log into the game (default)
/ai login off     - Keep auto invites enabled whenever you log into the game
```

## Setting the invite message
Finally, to set the invite code/message just type /ai and then the message you want that isn't one of the commands.

For example, to set the code/message to 1:
`/ai 1`

To set it to ilovejameis:
`/ai ilovejameis`

## Misc/Notes
I highly recommend you use the `/ai login on` command. It's super useful so you don't get trolled. Cause if you're like me, you'll forget it's enabled and people will randomly type 1 in guild chat and join your group.
